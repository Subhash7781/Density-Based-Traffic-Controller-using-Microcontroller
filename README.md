**INRODUCTION**

Density Based Traffic Signal System:

The main concept of Density Based Traffic Signal System is to combine hardware and software components. In some cases, mechanical components are also combined to perform a specific task. It is a micro controller-based software driven real time control system. It is not a computer system which is mainly used for processing, not a software system, not a traditional business application. Generally, there are two kinds of embedded systems namely High-end embedded systems and Low-end embedded systems. Highend embedded systems deal with 32- & 64-bit controllers while Low-end embedded systems work with 8- & 16-bit controllers.
1.It is evident through the roads that the number of vehicles are increasing rapidly.

2. This results in congested roads that are very hard to manage.

3. Hard to be punctual , resulting in rash driving, rule breaks and accidents.

4. Invented signals.

Futile signal.

**DESIGN AND COMPONENTS**

Hardware Unit:-

The hardware unit consists of a Microcontroller(Arduino UNO ) two ultra-Sonic Sensors(HC-SR04), bunch of LEDs and a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)sensor.

1. Microcontroller

**Results and Analysis**
The entire schematic was designed in Tinker cad Professional and verified whether everything was connected. Then generated the circuit Layout files using the built-in option available in Proteus. Even tested each component before soldering them on realtime to make sure that everything is proper working condition. After that, coded the Microcontroller using Arduino IDE and verified the output.

All the hardware components were successfully soldered on PCB and each component was tested properly for the better functioning of the system. The output given by the hardware units were as expected.

**CONCLUSION**
We have successfully developed a system where people will be able to have a safe and organised road traffic and a disciplined driver. We have used two ultrasonic sensors and named the distance they measure as D1 and D2 integrated with a small microcontroller
